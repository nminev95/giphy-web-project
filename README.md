# giphy-web-project
Giphy web project is an app built with JQuery and integrated with the Giphy API

This project was my first project in the Telerik Academy JavaScript bootcamp course in 2020.

Users can browse through GIFs with infite scroll functionality, they can upload gifs, search for gifs and add gifs to favourites.

How to run:

```
npm start
```
